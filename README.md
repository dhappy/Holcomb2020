## Issues

### Economy

* Mimis is a real-time simulation of the world. Represented are:
    - All the economic transactions
    - All life
    - All the land
    
### Crime

Start with making basic needs guaranteed. I posit there could then be a rat park effect allowing us to end the drug war and begin using an experience recommender which includes substance use.

### Execution of the Office

* [Public Office](Public_Office.md)
