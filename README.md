# What I'd do as P'o't'US

Mostly create software. I believe relatively recent changes in our communications capacities enables new systems of commerce and governance.

## Execution of the Office

As President, I would livestream my execution of the office and utelize a variety of mechanisms to get feedback from the world at large.

I would spearhead the creation of a reliable electronic identity for use in realtime feedback as well as choosing electors.

## War

I would immedately withdraw from all foreign wars. I would blanket conflict areas with phones along with the accompanying network coverage.

I would work on distributed democracy systems for both home and abroad.

### Collaborative Series

Data from umpteen thousands of cameras is streaming into a distributed archive for any given moment. I would create tools to sustain, navigate, and curate this dataset.

## Economy

Create an "Open Market" where the realtime data backing the inventory and point of sale systems is public. Anyone who wants to work on improving efficience can.


### Jobs

* Mimis is a real-time simulation of the world. Represented are:
    - All the economic transactions
    - All life
    - All the land

The goal of the software systems I will create is to look at the whole picture of where all the people are, what needs doing, and generate suggestions for the next activity.

## Society

I will found the Gaianist church which is atheist, but recognizes the cognitive mode called "being moved by the Spirit". So we accept the prayerful mind of the Judiastic religions, but holds that it is a purely physical cognitive phenomenon.

* Polyamorous. Specifically that it will be common for people to wear five wedding bands.

### Crime

Start with making basic needs guaranteed. I posit there could then be a rat park effect allowing us to end the drug war and begin using an experience recommender which includes recreational pharmachology.

### Homelessness

Yggdrasil is a "game" played using the data in MÃ¯mis. There are ten teams. One of the big functions of the teams is controlling access to space.

We want to [divide the US up]().

### Hunger



## Campaign Funding

We like in part the idea of rewards for donating that we'll fulfil if we win.

* Bluetooth Jeweler's Scale
** Coordinates with [tracking app](//track.dhappy.org) to measure consumption of substances and food
* DoH Bowl Pipe
* Personalized Gun w/ Nonlethal Ammunition

## Development
