I've long been fixated on the fact that the hemispheres are large highly-interconnected pieces of tissue relative to the corpus callosum. They cannot stay in perfect sync.

My current theory id that we are all sets of selves. A self being, amongs other things:

* A set of persistent body tensions
* Access to a set of memories
* An overarching persona

Each of these selves represents a fundamental conflict
